# SafetyKit "Get a Demo" Button - Prototype Fix

This is a working prototype that fixes an unresponsive "Get a Demo" button on the SafetyKit marketing site, discovered on June 27, 2025.

## The Problem
The 'Get a Demo' button at the bottom of the main page was unresponsive. It provided no user feedback and did not capture the lead's email, potentially resulting in lost business opportunities.

## The Solution
A standalone HTML/CSS/JS prototype that:

Replicates the original UI.

Uses JavaScript to capture the email and provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

Sends the form data to a working endpoint (Formspree) to ensure the lead is captured.

## How to Run Simply open the 'index.html' file in any modern web browser.# safetykit-demo-fix
